## Industry-Specific Coding Standards

- 
## Variable Naming Conventions

- #Multiword-Delimited – Used to separate multiple words in a variable name without white space.
- #Hungarian-Notation – This convention describes the purpose or type of the variable in the first part of the variable name, and then uses a descriptor to indicate the variable’s function. In Hungarian notation, the **camelCase** notation is used to delimit the words (camelCase)
- Other notations: **snake_case**, **kebab-case**, **PascalCase** (for class names)

## Class and Function Naming Conventions

- Same as Variable Naming Conventions, to make the code more readable
- Make sure that the variables, functions, and classes within your code can be easily distinguished from one another.

## Clear and Concise Comments

- Help fellow programmers to understand the Code
- Labelling complex sections
- Dividing code into logical segments
- Setting a reminder that a particular section needs updating
- **Implementation Comments**
- **Documentation Comments**

### When to Add comments

- Include comments for intricate or non-obvious code segments.
- Explain business rules, domain-specific logic, or regulatory requirements.
- Clarify how your code handles edge cases or exceptional scenarios.
- Document workarounds due to limitations or external dependencies.
- Mark areas where improvements or additional features are needed.

### When Not to add comments:

- Avoid redundant comments that merely repeat what the code already expresses clearly.
- If the code’s purpose is evident (e.g., simple variable assignments), skip unnecessary comments.
- Remove temporary comments used for debugging once the issue is resolved.
- Incorrect comments can mislead other developers, so ensure accuracy.

## Intentations

- Correct Spacing, line length, wraps and breaks
- White spacing and tabs to make the code more readable

## Portability

- Parametrize hard-coded values
- Use **property files, databases** or **application servers**

## Reusability and Scalability

- Incorporate updates and make the code reusable

## Exception handling

- Use try and catch blocks (with *finally*)

## Testing

- Prepare and plan the test cases ahead of time (deadline?)


- High-quality code follows consistent naming conventions, indentation, and formatting.
- Well-structured code reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs or security vulnerabilities.
- When everyone follows coding standards, collaboration becomes smoother.
- Clean code is more maintainable over time.
- Refactoring becomes less daunting when code quality is high.
