## User Flow

## Clear Message

## User Control

## Consistency
- Colors and design should be kept the same

## Minimalistic Design
- Use maximum five colors (+- 5)
- Simple fonts
- Only use graphics if they help the user complete a task

## Visual Hierarchy
- Biggest elements are most important
- see [[Homechoice Visual Hierarchy]]

## Navigability
- Where is the search bar?
- Login Button?
- How many levels does it have?
	- Home -> Movies, recommended, ... -> Subcategories
- Where's the payment information? It should be mostly one level deep

## Responsivity
- compatibility with different browsers and on the mobile device too
- Apparently, the [[designerror1.png]] is not correctly displayed on chrome but on Firefox it's okay

## Accessibility
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust
- Website should be usable by disabled too
- Establish an English version to make it usable for internationals

## Conventionality
- Main Navigation at top
- Logo at top left or center
- Bring visitor to home page by clicking the logo (why doesn't it do that on the company information website?)
- Buttons change color or appearance when hovering over them
- Image sliders have buttons to let the user manually handle the slide

## Credibility
- Be clear and honest about product
