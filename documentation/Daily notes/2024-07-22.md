### Day 1 (2024-07-21)

1. **Task Creation Functionality**:
    
    - Implemented a Django view for creating tasks with various fields such as title, description, status, assignee, start date, deadline, and priority.
    - Ensured that the task creation form included CSRF tokens and appropriate validation for date fields to ensure the start date is before the deadline.
    - Added functionality to send a POST request to an API endpoint for creating tasks, including JWT authentication.
2. **API Handling and Error Management**:
    
    - Set up JWT token generation and inclusion in headers for API requests.
    - Implemented error handling to manage and display appropriate error messages if the API request failed or if there were validation issues.
3. **Timezone Handling for Dates**:
    
    - Ensured that date and time fields were converted to timezone-aware datetime objects to handle different time zones correctly.
    - Modified the form and backend logic to ensure consistent handling of datetime fields.

### Day 2

1. **Task Update Functionality**:
    
    - Created a Django view for updating existing tasks, similar to the task creation view, including handling various fields and ensuring proper data validation.
    - Incorporated JWT token handling and API requests for updating tasks using PATCH requests.
    - Filtered out any empty fields during updates to ensure only provided fields were updated.
2. **API Endpoint Improvements**:
    
    - Improved the `put` and `patch` methods in the API view to handle full and partial updates of tasks.
    - Ensured datetime fields were converted to timezone-aware datetime objects during updates.
    - Added email notifications and scheduling of deadline warning tasks for both creation and update operations.
    - Added permission checks to ensure only authorized users (superusers or the assignee) could update tasks.
3. **Form and API Response Comparison**:
    
    - Implemented logic to format datetime values consistently in the HTML form to match the expected format in unit tests.
    - Ensured that data sent to and received from the API was correctly formatted and handled.

### Overall Enhancements

- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling and logging to diagnose issues effectively.
- **Authorization**: Added JWT-based authentication for secure API requests.
- **Email Notifications**: Set up email notifications for task creation and updates, including scheduling of reminder emails.
- **Date and Time Consistency**: Ensured consistent handling of datetime fields across different parts of the application, taking into account time zones.

These improvements and additions collectively enhanced the functionality, security, and user experience of the task management system.
