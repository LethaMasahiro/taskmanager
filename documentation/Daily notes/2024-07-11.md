### Task Overview

1. **Django Application Setup for API Access**:
    
    - Set up URL configurations to enable API endpoints.
    - Ensured proper routing and inclusion of the `DefaultRouter` and viewsets for handling API requests.
2. **Fixing and Testing URL Configuration**:
    
    - Configured `urls.py` in both `backend` and `taskmanagerapp` to include API routes.
    - Corrected URL patterns to ensure the API endpoints are accessible.
3. **Views and Serializers Setup**:
    
    - Created and adjusted views to handle API requests using Django Rest Framework.
    - Implemented `TaskViewSet` for CRUD operations and `TaskListApiView` for listing tasks.
    - Developed serializers for the `Task` model.
4. **Addressing Issues**:
    
    - Solved the issue where the API was not found by correcting URL patterns.
    - Resolved the issue of improper request headers in Postman by adjusting the expected Accept header.
    - Corrected the filter issue in the `TaskListApiView` to ensure it properly filters tasks by the authenticated user.

### Future Steps

1. **Implement Authentication**:
    
    - Set up token-based authentication to secure API endpoints.
    - Ensure proper authentication is handled in Postman for API testing.
2. **Testing API with Authentication**:
    
    - Obtain authentication tokens and use them in Postman to make authenticated requests.
    - Verify that authenticated endpoints are accessible and return the correct data.
3. **Additional Configurations**:
    
    - Continue refining views and serializers as needed for additional functionality.
    - Ensure proper error handling and response statuses in the API.
