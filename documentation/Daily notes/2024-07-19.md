1. **Table Sorting and Filtering:**
    
    - Implemented a table sorting feature by clicking on the table headers. The sorting functionality dynamically fetches sorted data from the backend using the `fetch` API.
    - Implemented a `formatDate` function to format date strings into a readable format (D/M/Y H
        
        ).
2. **Dynamic URL Handling:**
    
    - Integrated Django URL patterns into JavaScript by embedding URL templates in a `<script>` tag with `id="url-patterns"`.
    - Dynamically generated URLs for update and delete actions using these templates, replacing placeholders with actual task IDs.
3. **Dynamic Table Update:**
    
    - Populated table rows dynamically using JavaScript based on tasks data retrieved from Django.
    - Added "Update" and "Delete" buttons for each task row. Used JavaScript to dynamically create these buttons and set their actions using the URL templates.
4. **Handling CSRF Token:**
    
    - Included the CSRF token in the delete form by using a hidden input field to ensure secure form submissions.
5. **Data Mapping:**
    
    - Created a lookup map (`assigneeMap`) in JavaScript to map task IDs to assignee names for easier access.
6. **JavaScript Cleanup:**
    
    - Refactored JavaScript to use variables and dynamically construct URLs for task actions.
    - Removed the `.value` property from the CSRF token input as requested, ensuring correct handling of form submissions.

### Code Adjustments

- **HTML**:
    
    - Added a script to hold URL patterns for updating and deleting tasks.
    - Used Django template tags to embed URL patterns with placeholders for task IDs.
- **JavaScript**:
    
    - Updated the `updateTable` function to dynamically generate URLs and populate table rows.
    - Added a function to confirm deletion with a user prompt.
    - Adjusted event listeners for sorting functionality to work with the updated table structure.

### Next Steps

- **Testing**:
    
    - Test the sorting, updating, and deleting functionality to ensure everything works as expected.
    - Verify that the table updates correctly with sorted data and that the URLs for update and delete actions are properly constructed.
- **Code Cleanup**:
    
    - Review and clean up the code for better readability and maintainability.
    - Update and test email functionality as needed.
