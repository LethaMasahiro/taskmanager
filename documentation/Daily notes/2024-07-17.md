## Summary of Updates for Django Project

### 1. **Added JWT Authentication to Django Views**

- **Purpose**: Secured API interactions by using JWT tokens for authentication in `admin_tasklist` and `user_tasklist` views.
- **How It Works**: Generated JWT tokens in the views and included them in the headers of requests to the API endpoints.

### 2. **Fixed Task Update Functionality**

- **Purpose**: Ensured that the task update page displays the correct current values for fields and handles `description` properly.
- **Issues Fixed**:
  - **Pre-Selected Values**: Updated the `task_update` view and template to ensure that the correct `priority`, `status`, and `assignee` values are displayed in the form.
  - **Description Handling**: Removed extra whitespace from the `description` field in the template.

### 3. **Improved Enum Display**

- **Purpose**: Displayed `priority` and `status` Enum choices in a user-friendly format with proper spacing and capitalization.
- **How It Works**:
  - Added a custom template filter to convert Enum values into readable labels.
  - Updated the templates to use this filter for displaying Enum fields.

### 4. **Updated Templates for Better Form Handling**

- **Purpose**: Improved form templates for task creation and updating to ensure correct default values and better user experience.
- **Changes Made**:
  - **Task Update Template**: Corrected how `priority`, `status`, and `assignee` values are selected in the form.
  - **Added Validation**: Added JavaScript validation to ensure that the end date is after the start date in the task update form.

### 5. **Created a Custom Template Filter for Enum Labels**

- **Purpose**: Facilitated the display of Enum choices as readable text in the templates.
- **How It Works**: Defined a custom template filter to convert Enum values into their display labels using the `enum_label` filter.

### 6. **Handled Enum Labels in Forms**

- **Purpose**: Displayed human-readable Enum labels in forms for task creation and updating.
- **How It Works**: Updated the forms to correctly display `priority` and `status` Enum choices with labels.

### 7. **Validated Form Submissions**

- **Purpose**: Ensured that form submissions meet validation requirements.
- **How It Works**: Added client-side validation in JavaScript to check that the start date is before the end date in the task update form.

### To-Do List

1. **Test Changes Thoroughly**: Verify that JWT authentication is working, that the task update form displays the correct values, and that Enum labels are shown correctly.
2. **Document Changes**: Update your project documentation with the details of the new JWT authentication mechanism, Enum handling, and form validation improvements.
3. **Deploy Updates**: Push the changes to your production environment and monitor for any issues.
