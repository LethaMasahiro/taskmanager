- **Fixed `POST` Request Logic:**
    
    - Updated the `post` method to handle the creation of tasks while ensuring that only superusers can create tasks.
    - Added logic to handle and convert datetime fields (`startDate` and `deadline`) to naive datetimes if necessary.
    - Implemented email notifications using `send_task_email_to_assignee_created.delay`.
    - Scheduled a warning email to be sent 24 hours before the task deadline using `warn_users_one_day_before_deadline.apply_async`.
- **Debugging and Handling Errors:**
    
    - Addressed issues with error handling in the `task_create` view by adding debugging statements and proper JSON decoding to handle potential errors.
    - Updated error handling to print relevant error information and properly render the error page.
- **Timezone Handling:**
    
    - Converted code to use aware datetime objects and implemented timezone handling with `pytz`.
    - Provided instructions on how to install `pytz` in a Docker environment and configure Django to use the Korean timezone (`Asia/Seoul`).
- **Docker Configuration:**
    
    - Explained how to add `pytz` to the Docker setup, either through `requirements.txt` or directly in the Dockerfile.
    - Provided instructions for rebuilding and restarting Docker containers to apply changes.
- **Preparation for Testing:**
    
    - Mentioned the next steps for writing test cases to ensure the functionality works as expected.
    - Discussed the plan for highlighting tasks that are due soon.
