## Summary of Today's Work on the Django Project

### 1. **Adding a Delete Button in the Task List**

- **Issue:** You wanted to add a button to delete tasks from the task list view.
- **Solution:**
    - Added a `Delete` button in the `tasklist.html` template next to each task.
        
    - Created a `task_delete` view function to handle the deletion process.
        
    - Configured the URL for the delete action and added it to the `tasklist.html` template.
        
    - Implemented JavaScript to show a confirmation dialog before deletion.
        
    - Example Code:
        
        html
        
        Code kopieren
        
        `<form method="post" action="{% url 'deletetask' task.id %}" style="display: inline;">     {% csrf_token %}     <button type="submit" class="btn btn-danger btn-sm" onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete the task "{{ task.title }}"?')">Delete</button> </form>`
        

### 2. **Adding Email Functionality with Celery**

- **Issue:** You wanted to send an email when a task is assigned to a user.
    
- **Solution:**
    
    - Configured email settings in `settings.py` for Gmail using App Password.
        
    - Created a Celery task (`send_task_email_to_assignee`) to send the email.
        
    - Added necessary imports and setup for Celery in `tasks.py`.
        
    - Example Code:
        
        python
        
        Code kopieren
        
        `from celery import shared_task from django.core.mail import send_mail from django.conf import settings  @shared_task def send_task_email_to_assignee(assignee_email, task_title):     send_mail(         'New Task Assigned',         f'You have been assigned a new task: {task_title}',         settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,         [assignee_email],         fail_silently=False,     )`
        
- **Problem Encountered:** Errors related to Celery and SMTP settings.
    
    - **Solutions Provided:**
        - Fixed the `send_mail` arguments.
        - Generated a new App Password and updated `settings.py`.
        - Verified email configuration by sending a test email from the Django shell.

### 3. **Understanding App Passwords for Gmail**

- **Explanation:** An App Password is a 16-character code used for applications that need to access your Google account with 2-Step Verification enabled.
- **How to Generate:**
    - Go to Google Account Security Settings.
    - Generate a new App Password for the application (e.g., Celery).
    - Update `settings.py` with your Gmail address and the generated App Password.

### 4. **Celery Task Configuration**

- **Issue:** Celery was not recognizing the task due to incorrect configuration.
- **Solution:**
    - Added Celery imports and configured the task settings.
    - Ensured that `taskmanagerapp.tasks.send_task_email_to_assignee` was properly registered.

### 5. **General Celery Setup**

- **Example Configuration for `settings.py`:**
    
    python
    
    Code kopieren
    
    `CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0' CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379/0' CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['json'] CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json' CELERY_RESULT_SERIALIZER = 'json' CELERY_TIMEZONE = 'UTC'`
    
- **How to Verify:** Ran a test task to ensure Celery was working correctly.
